# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed all Java Warmup-1 exercises from [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1 "Coding Bat")

**Thoughts:** I decided to begin my 100 days by doing some basic code practice. I intend to do this for the first week before moving on to increasingly more advanced projects. I do not currently have a project in the works, so I felt like this was a good way to get started with my 100 days.

### Day 1: August 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for 2 hours. About 80% done with the code.

**Thoughts:** I found [this](http://www.netinstructions.com/next-steps-for-aspiring-programmers-after-you-know-the-basics "'Net Instructions") last night. I decided to give these projects a go to make things a little more interesting. I may still do some coding exercises here and there, but I want to actually create something!
