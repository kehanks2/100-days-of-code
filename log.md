# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed all Java Warmup-1 exercises from Coding Bat https://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1

**Thoughts:** I decided to begin my 100 days by doing some basic code practice. I intend to do this for the first week before moving on to increasingly more advanced projects. I do not currently have a project in the works, so I felt like this was a good way to get started with my 100 days.
